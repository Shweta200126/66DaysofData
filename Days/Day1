Hello, visitor!
This is the first day of me officially starting this challenge cum learning cum habit maker! for learning Data Science.

Until now, I have completed some basic fundamentals required for Data Science from 365 Data Science courses. 
Those are:
1. Introduction to Data and Data Science
2. Introduction to Jupyter
3. Introduction to Python
4. Intoduction to Excel

So many introductions right? Yeah, but they were pretty fun to learn from surprisingly, the way the exercises emphasis the concept taught in the video is amazing! I learnt quite a lot from there only.

Today I resumed Statistics course in Data Science/ Analyst career track, wel'll see which one I finish. 

Completed on Day 1:
1. Descriptive Statistics Fundamentals
2. Inferential Statistics Fundamentals

I wish to learn Statistics by tomorrow. :)

Thank you for reading so far.
