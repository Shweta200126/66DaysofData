Hello, visitor!
<br>
Today is 6th November 2021, and you're from future!
<br>
This is the first day of me officially starting #66DaysofData challenge cum learning cum habit maker! for learning Data Science.

Until now, I have completed some basic fundamentals required for Data Science from 365 Data Science courses.<br>
Those are:
1. [Introduction to Data and Data Science](https://learn.365datascience.com/c/8a3ba5ab83/)
2. [Introduction to Jupyter](https://learn.365datascience.com/c/996be08b22/)
3. [Introduction to Python](https://learn.365datascience.com/c/afe5cc636c/)
4. [Intoduction to Excel](https://learn.365datascience.com/c/6ff0366fa8/)

So many introductions right? Yeah, but they were pretty fun to learn from surprisingly, the way the exercises emphasis the concept taught in the video is amazing! I learnt quite a lot from there only. I really appreciate the learning path they have given or else I'd have been lost what to learn or not.

Today I resumed Statistics course in Data Science/ Analyst career track, wel'll see which one I finish. 

Completed on ```Day 1```:
1. Descriptive Statistics Fundamentals
2. Inferential Statistics Fundamentals

I wish to learn Statistics by tomorrow. :)

Thank you for reading so far.
