Hello everyone, 
<p>

`Day 11: 19th November 2021`

<p>
Today I did quite new things, mostley implemented them so more practice and thinking work happended. 
<br>
Finished exercises, learnt about Matplotlib and image library and worked with those and learnt about stacks and did some basic question. Learnt about "Tower of Hanoi" and solved it using recursive function. Also learnt enumerate, sets and none at the end. 
<br>
Will start Search and sort algorithm from tomorrow and hopefully finish the course as well!

Thank you for reading so far!
