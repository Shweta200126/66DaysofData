Hello everyone to Day 12, :wave:
<p>
I did Object oriented programming (OOP) today and started search and sort in the lessons, just did "linear search". I have posted OOP for reference which I will sure need and since I am using Jupyter, it has 'h' for its shortcut list to appear.
<p>
That's all for Day 12, it mostly was occupied with travelling. 
<p>
Have a nice day! :wave:
