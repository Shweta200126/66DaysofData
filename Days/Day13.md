Hello everyone :wave:

`Day 13`

I did Luhn's algorithm today in Python and explained the entire code and concept of finding whether a credit card number is valid or not. It was fun! I recorded myself and thought that I was teaching to somebody, took time but it was amazing to understand it clearly :)

Thats all for today, thanks for tuning in :)
