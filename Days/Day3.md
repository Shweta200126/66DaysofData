Hello to Day 3 ðŸŒž
I didn't do much of statistics today, my classes resumed as well ðŸ˜¢ after long festival holidays. Health got better though, sun was shining.

Started Hypothesis testing, its concept is clear but at the same time I'm kinda lost! The thing is I understand but there are technical terms which confuse me a lot. Hopefully by Day 4 it'll be clear!

Being consistent is difficult y'all but it feels amazing :)

On to Day 4 and hopefully finishing Statistics!
Bye ðŸ‘‹
