This is finally Day 4, ðŸŽŠ
<p>
Today I finished the last remaining lessons of Hypothesis testing and did entire revision of Statistics from the pdf given in the course; gotta say it helped immensely that I did revision before sitting for exam. I barely passed it but it happened more so because of me wronly interpretting the questions, I did well in direct questions but where least accurate or where wordings played a main role, I just read half of it and was like YES but should have been more focused while reading it! Though the test was easy, I didn't expect that lol. I did 27/30 questions, I am very proud of that. I will do this test again in future though, to not only increase my percentage but also firm my understandings, I need that.

Here's my certificate:

Till Day 5, which I'm really excited about since it won't be about Statistics anymore! I'll do Git tomorrow, need a relaxing time now ðŸ˜ƒ
