Hello everyone! 👋
<p>
This is Day 5. I learnt Git and Github by Giles McMullen-Klein at 365 Data Science. 🎊 🎊 It was very cool to finally learn it and this Day 5 text is being written on my local machine also, not directly at Github after saving, I'll push it to Github. I practised the basics too and asked doubts to my senior and she helped me a lot in clearing my doubts! I can finally do the basic stuffs through git. I made notes of these too! I am thinking of making a Github repository to list them so that I don't lose my basic methods of doing stuff. 
<p>
I had a great Day 5, hopefully all coming days will be cool too :) 🎊
<p>
Bye 👋

Thank you for reading! 🙏
