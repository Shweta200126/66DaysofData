Hello! :wave:

`Day 6`

I did more of Git and GitHub practices! Made a repository to store instructions to do for the same. 
<p>
Saw many intro videos by 365 Data Science to choose which course to do next. Python one seems very likely and I have done 6% of it as well. This is the last week of its free month and I want to learn as much as I can but Ik it'll take time  so I'll just do what I am doing and give it my best shot, I wanted to completed Data Science track but seems imposible now, it had so many things I wanted to learn. 
<p>
I really want to complete:
1. Python Programmer Bootcamp
2. Probability
3. Mathematics
4. SQL
5. Machine learning with Python
<p>
But Ik it won't be possible in just a week, so I'll just solidfy the basics! 
<p>
That's all for Day 6 and now on to Day 7 and I pretty much will finish Python today, fingers crossed to my wish, lol. :fingers-crossed:
<p>
Thank you for reading. :wave:
