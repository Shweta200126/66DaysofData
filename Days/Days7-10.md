Hello everyone, 
<p>
  
`Days: 7-10`
  
<p>
This is a summary of Days 7 to 10, I didn't do anypractice for two days and was doing little little practice in Python for these days.
<p>
Today is day 11th on 19th November 2021 and I am really excited to continue, one good reason is the 365 Data Science have extended their free courses time by 3 days, :crossed_fingers: may I complete this awesome Python course, I am really liking it more so because I learnt about Ceasar cipher, it was highlight of Day 10 for me. I'll make sure to add the code here. 
<p>
Till next time, :wave:
<p>
Thank you for reading so far.

Greetings,
